</ul><p>As a lifelong learner, one thing you may come to ask yourself is:</p>

<p>“What’s the best way to learn? And why wasn’t I taught it?”</p>

<p>It seems to me that formal education provides us with little option other than to tackle this problem in our own way, with limited knowledge of how memory, concentration or the brain in general functions. This leads us to, more often than not, stumble into our own method of intaking, digesting and retaining information. In most cases this is likely formed out of habit, rather than design, which is surely a waste of mental potential.</p>

<p>Having recently decided to undertake further study at post-graduate level, I have become very interested in maximising my mental capacity and this has lead to to discover a few fascinating resources on meta-learning:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn (Coursera)</a></li>
  <li>Jim Kwik’s <a href="https://jimkwik.com/category/podcast/">Kwik Brain Podcast</a>
</li>
</ol>

<p>These posts will discuss what I have learned from the former Coursera course for the time being.</p>

<h2 id="learning-how-to-learn---week-1---what-is-learning">
<a class="anchor" href="#learning-how-to-learn---week-1---what-is-learning" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Learning How to Learn - Week 1 - What is Learning?</h2>

<h2 id="modes-of-thinking">
<a class="anchor" href="#modes-of-thinking" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modes of Thinking</h2>

<p>The course starts with an introduction to what modes of thinking are present during the learning process. These can be described as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focused</li>
  <li>Diffuse</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Focused Mode</strong> refers to the analytical, focused mode whereby we are using familiar relations and known entities to work through a problem, or produce a specific outcome. It’s the technical adviser.</p>

<p>The <strong>Diffuse Mode</strong> refers to that broader, open state of mind, whereby we are making new connections and having a “big picture” perspective. It’s the creative.</p>

<p>However, here’s the crux of it: We can’t be in both modes at the same time.</p>

<p>When learning something new, we need to be able to switch between these modes in order to focus intently, take in information and relate it to what we already know and then further synthesize this information during periods of free thought. It’s like working out - you can’t keep busting reps forever, you’ll do yourself damage before long. Instead, you need to focus intently, do the reps and then allow your body to recover and grow muscles, or in this case - synapses.</p>

<p>Einstein famously relied on “creative play” in his thought experiments to come up with his greatest work.</p>

<p>What’smore, Dali and Edison both used a similar trick, which was critical to their creativity - that is, relax into a chair and allow your mind to go blank, but while holding an object (e.g. ball bearings/a watch), then at the moment at which you almost fall asleep and the objects fall out of your hand onto the floor - bingo! Hello Diffuse Mode.</p>

<p>At that point, they would have entered the free-associative mode and could come up with interesting new takes on their work or the problem. So here comes the first interesting aspect of sleep…</p>

<h2 id="upgrading-your-brain">
<a class="anchor" href="#upgrading-your-brain" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upgrading Your Brain</h2>

<p>There are a few ways we can improve our mental performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sleep</li>
  <li>Exercise</li>
  <li>Stimulating Environment</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sleep">
<a class="anchor" href="#sleep" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sleep</h2>

<p>Sleep is like giving your mind an upgrade. It is perhaps the most important aspect in all of our mental and physical health: “Why We Sleep” gives a fascinating insight into the huge array of processes that are both helped and hindered by a sufficient amount or lack thereof sleep… my main take away from this book was: “SLEEEEEEEEEEP!”. A more than worthy lesson in a world that still seems to have a universally outdated approach to work (where I live, they say: “El que madruga coge la oruga”), a terrible caffeine addiction and all the while a mobile phone blasting blue-light into our retinas.</p>

<p>During the learning process, even just 24hours later after sleep, new synapses form along the dendrites of neurons. It’s a remarkable process really.</p>

<p>In addition, sleep clears out toxic plaque from between the brain cells - your brain cells literally shrink and allow this to happen. Without sleep, nope.</p>

<p>In addition, during the deeper phases of sleep, the brain is literally re-organising itself to form deeper neural connections - ideas and concepts made more concrete. But we need time for the concrete to set.</p>

<p>So this explains why cramming is such a poor idea, yet still so prevalent in many learners - we are not taught the costs of doing so - i.e. no long term retention, no actually understanding, just surface level.</p>

<p>One other intersting aspect of sleep is that if we dream about the subjects we are studying, this can help to solidify that knowledge in what is known as <strong>chunking</strong> (discussed later). Hence, actively reading before bed can be very useful.</p>

<h2 id="exercise">
<a class="anchor" href="#exercise" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exercise</h2>

<p>Exercise is critically important to forming new synapses.</p>

<h2 id="procrastination-memory-practice">
<a class="anchor" href="#procrastination-memory-practice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Procrastination, Memory, Practice</h2>

<p><strong>Procrastination</strong></p>

<p>This is a problem we all face at one time or another… it took me 2 months before I worked up the courage to start blogging about my Machine Learning journey.</p>

<p>The reason this happens is that the when thinking about something we don’t want to do the Insular Cortex (the pain centre of the brain)  reacts - therefore making us turn away from the problem to something more enjoyable. However, this enjoyment is only temporary and when we return to that oh-so terrible thing, we do it all over again. In my case, the potential of being judged, getting something wrong, or looking like a fool (all rooted in fear) was the cause.</p>

<p>So how do we tackle this and move forward?</p>

<p>The recommended technique in the course is to use Pomodoro - i.e. 25 minutes focused, hard work and then a 5 minute break with a reward (music, chocolate - a deeper chocolate addiction here I come) repeated over the course of the day. In this way we break down the unapproachable turd-sandwich into a smaller, more manageable slice of smelliness.</p>

<p>Interestingly, once we started working on it - that neural discomfort tends to reduce. So what was all the fuss about?</p>

<p><strong>Memory</strong></p>

<p>There are two principal parts to memory: <strong>Working</strong> and <strong>Long-Term</strong>.</p>

<p>In Working memory it appears as if we have about 4 “slots” available to us at any one time…  not much! Working memory uses “chunks” whereby similar items are grouped together. The analogy used in the course is that it’s like an inefficient mental blackboard, where items can easily get wiped away.</p>

<p>In Long-Term memory, we can have <em>billions</em> of items, however, in the massive distributed storage warehouse of our brain. In order to retain access though, we need to keep retracting our steps to find it. This is where active recall is critically important in re-enforcing the neural pathways.</p>

<p>So why is our working memory so poor? To answer that, there’s an evolutionary reason, explained brilliantly by these lab tests. So much for “monkey mind” …:</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTgeLEWr614</p>

<p>In terms of memory tips and tricks, this is definitely Jim Kwik’s wheelhouse - he has some phenomenal tips for memory, one of which is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>TIP</strong> - <strong>T</strong>urn <strong>I</strong>nto <strong>P</strong>icture - we have an innately visual memory - use it! See the Loci Method, for one.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practice Makes Permanent</strong></p>

<p>We’ve all heard the old adage “Practice Makes Perfect” - but this is slightly misleading - if we do something, for however long, in an unfocused, slapdash manner… it ain’t going to be perfect. It’s going to be permanent. So, right practice is crucial.</p>

<p>In abstract subjects, with a lot of technical content, such as maths and science, it is critical to practice with the ideas in order to ingrain them more permanently - no non-genius ever sat down and solved a partial differential equation without knowing differential calculus and then building on top of it, for example.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a side note: I cannot recommended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3blue1brown</a> enough if you want a crystal clear, tangible understanding of even hard-to-grasp maths concepts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To make concepts concrete, we therefore need to follow some simple steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Study hard (Focus Mode)</li>
  <li>Take a break (Diffuse Mode)</li>
  <li>Repeat</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Spaced Repetition</strong></p>

<p>Spaced repetition is an extremely effective way of building those synaptic connections. The spacing allows these neural pathways to form and be better consolidated. Again, the brai n needs <strong>time</strong> and <strong>repetition</strong> for true retainment. For example, we could follow the following study routine for a subject:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Monday</th>
      <th>Tuesday</th>
      <th>Wednesday</th>
      <th>Thursday</th>
      <th>Friday</th>
      <th>Saturday</th>
      <th>Sunday</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Study</td>
      <td>Study</td>
      <td>Study</td>
      <td>Rest</td>
      <td>Study</td>
      <td>Rest</td>
      <td>Study</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
